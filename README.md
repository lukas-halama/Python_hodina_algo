Here is a more universal README.md designed to grow with your repository. It provides a general structure for Python algorithms and exercises, making it easy to add new scripts to the list as you create them.

Python_hodina_algo

Welcome to Python_hodina_algo. This repository serves as a collection of Python exercises, algorithmic solutions, and code snippets designed for learning and practice.

📂 Project Structure

This project is organized as a collection of standalone scripts. As new topics are covered, more files will be added here.

Current Exercises

Below is a list of the algorithms and tests currently available in the repository:

    stromecek.py: A logic exercise that generates a symmetrical pyramid (tree) of stars based on user input. It calculates spacing dynamically to center the output.

    zadani_cisla.py: An interactive loop that asks for numerical input and returns the double of that number. Includes an exit condition (input 0) to break the loop.

    test.py: A basic script for testing for loops and simple arithmetic operations.

🚀 How to Run

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can run any individual script from the terminal using the following command structure:
Bash

python <filename>.py

Examples:
Bash

# Run the pyramid generator
python stromecek.py

# Run the number doubler
python zadani_cisla.py

🛠 Future Additions

This repository is a work in progress. Future updates will include:

    More complex algorithms.

    Data structure implementations.

    Additional logic puzzles and homework solutions.

📝 Requirements

    Python 3.x
